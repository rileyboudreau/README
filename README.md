First, you must enter the DJ's roomcode! The DJ will have provided you with a four-digit combination that allows people to enter their unique event.

### Submitting Songs
![submit](http://i.imgur.com/RetiWW5.png)

You can submit songs to the DJ by following the instructions on screen.

Here you are required to input song name and artist. 

### Viewing the DJ's queue

If you don't make a request, you can also view what the DJ has in their queue. These are the songs that have been sent in from other partygoers. 

Simply tap "View queue" instead of "Submit Request", or press the "View queue" button after you submit a song instead of "BACK".

# Hosts

### Using the dashboard
![dashboard](http://i.imgur.com/gcUXAVF.png)

The dashboard in it's current version is very simple and basic. As requests are sent in, they appear in a list. These requests are then reviewed by the DJ (you). You can then add these songs to your playlist.

### Hosting an event

There is currently no automated way to host an event. Please contact info@mysong.ca to inquire about getting a roomcode.
